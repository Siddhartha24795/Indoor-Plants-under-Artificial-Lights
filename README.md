Method to have fastest growth of plants better than under sunlight, in Artificial lights using IoT and Deep learning
It explains how under controlled monitoring of plants under Artificial Lights, we can have fastest growth of plants better than Sunlight.
With the data collection and identifying the type of plants, the nature of light it will grow faster can easily be predicted.
